- Create function for gifs appearing according to the player's score.
- Build the score page
- Shuffle the questions fetched from firebase
- Randomize the answers fetched from firebase
- Learn to toggle pages instead of dynamic content
- Better understanding of firebase
- Pseudocoding
- Facebook authentication
- Learn teamwork
- Using github in group

### :grimacing: Description:

The Ultimate Marvel Fan Quiz is an online game that tests the user's knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe by presenting them with a series of questions, chosen randomly from a large pool, and asks them to select an answer from the four provided. The quiz can be taken on easy or hard difficulty, to cater to both casual and hardcore fans.

Questions and answers are stored in a Firestore database. The easy and hard questions and answers are retrieved and ten are selected randomly from the chosen difficulty when the game is started. The four answers are also randomized when displayed on the quiz page. Once the player has answered ten questions, their score will be stored in the database and a score page will be generated displaying the user's score, the average score for that difficulty, and a different gif/quote for each different score bracket.

### :blue_book: Learnings:
